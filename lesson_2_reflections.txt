What happens when you initiate a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A repository is a place where i can keep my file and maintain history as i change it during progression

How is the staging area different from the working directory and repository? What value do you think it offers?
Working directory is where uncommitted work in progress files are kept. Some maybe temporary in nature and do not need to be committed. Staging area allows separation of such file from the commit-intended files.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Run compare between it and Working Directory and well as between itself and latest commit.
